            Firsts things first. I'm <b>neither a woman nor am I a Japanese</b>, so it's not
            some kind of role-playing or whatever. It's just that I
            believe that

            <div>    
            I don't think that government (or any people having enough power and will)
            won't find me. But I've seen how often even great personailities had been destroyed
            by their ego.

            I think it really matters who did what, I don't like impostors. George Eliote published
            her first novel pseudonymously and had to reveal herself only after somebody claimed
            her work. We're living in times though when we have technical means to protect ourselves in such cases.
            So I will be Rachel Satoyama till the day I die.

            <h1>Conferences suck. All of them</h1>
            <div>
                If you want to share knowledge with the community you have at your disposal youtube and vimeo for
                recording whatever video you want, you have github to share code, you have stackoverflow,
                you have twitter, you have self-publishing platform, you have cheap hosting after all. 
            </div>
            <div>
                The goal of any conference is to promote particular stack of technologies in best case and in
                the worst case it's just a machine for making money. And I don't like machines making money.
                This leads to the next chapter of my "manifesto".

            <h1>We should do all within our power to make knowledge free</h1>
            <div>
                Money is crucial, it's hard to underestimate its importance. 
                However if each of us will at least try not to think about money all the time - 
                this world can be a better place. Think about it - your need more money
                because other people providing you services need money as well so that can also
                provide services. It's a trap, it's a gravitational black hole towards which we all are spiralling down.

                I do recognized that this is generally speaking unsolved problem for humankind - 
                we still got limited resources. I'm not an economist and I don't know all the answers.
            </div>
            <div>
                But I know for sure that still something can be done.
                Each of us can dedicate at least some of his time to make this world better
                (yeah, I know, I know, a very fresh and original idea).
                Don't sell tickets for your god damn freaking workshops. If you an expert in some area - 
                write a book and sell it. But at least consider an opporunity to make it downloadable
                for free. At least try.
